To run locally on your computer install the following node modules:

* ejs
* express

run "node server.js" (or nodemon) on your terminal and visit "localhost:3000"


Things I need to learn more about:

* Difference between using $scope or setting variables to 'this' on the controller. I can see that when you set the controller 'as something' in html, then you can access the same variables as 'something.variable'
